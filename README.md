# PEN PURSUE
## Technologies used:
* Give me a moment to write it and stuff
## Purpose:
* PEN PURSUE is an app which will allow writers to log their information of their writings. The app will have sections that will allow the writer to divide their works:
  1. Characters
  2. Settings
  3. Plot
  4. Chapters
  5. Other Notes
## How did I approach this app?
1. **April 28 2021**: After getting my app approval idea from the tech lead, I went straight ahead to create a wireframe. I wrote out how I want the app to function from the moment the user was to come across the app. I prefer to write things out because it allows me to use markers and other colorful pens to keep me interested as well as keep me productive. I had also written out some schemas as well as the basic formatting I want each of my pages to look like. Writing out my ideas and giving it form makes it easier for me to be able to translate my ideas to code that I can use.

### Possible Challenges:
1. I get my first dose of the COVID shot on Saturday....hopefully I won't be as out of commission as I fear but I want to be able to get my pages connected and running properly by the end of Tomorrow, work on Login Authentication on Friday to Saturday, and then worry about CSS from Sunday to Monday. I want to at least get a good night sleep before presentation day.
2. CSS. I just know that the CSS is going to make me cry like no other.

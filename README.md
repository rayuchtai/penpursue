# PEN PURSUE

#### Motivational Quote:

* "You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."
    - Jack London, author of "The Call of the Wild"

## Technologies used:
* Give me a moment to write it and stuff
## Purpose:
* PEN PURSUE is an app which will allow writers to log their information of their writings. The app will have sections that will allow the writer to divide their works:
  1. Characters
  2. Settings
  3. Plot
  4. Chapters
  5. Other Notes
## How did I approach this app?

## Project Daily Logs/Progess:
1. **April 28 2021**:
- After getting my app approval idea from the tech lead, I went straight ahead to create a wireframe. I wrote out how I want the app to function from the moment the user was to come across the app. I prefer to write things out because it allows me to use markers and other colorful pens to keep me interested as well as keep me productive. I had also written out some schemas as well as the basic formatting I want each of my pages to look like. Writing out my ideas and giving it form makes it easier for me to be able to translate my ideas to code that I can use.
2. **April 29 2021**:
- I was able to make Characters, Settings, and Plots full crud. There is probably a more dynamic and easier way to add all these sections. But I wanted to create separate sections to make it more organized. If I have more time, then I want add modals to have to have the basic information about the different types of the different sections. I think that maybe I should add the modals on the home page and the new page. Could be helpful for amateur writers. I think that if I was able to get the login Authentication with extra time then maybe I'll add the modals.
3. **April 30 2021**:
- Today has been a little slow......mostly because the motivation to code is very low. Coffee, tea, tofu, and soup had helped. I suppose I was just hungry. I plan on finishing the rest of the elements to be full crud. I will then focus on the login Authentication.

## Checklists

### Making the different Sections Full Crud:
- [x] Characters = Full Crud
- [x] Settings = Full Crud
- [x] Plots = Full Crud
- [x] Chapters = Full Crud
- [ ] Other Notes = Full Crud

### Lgin Authentication:
- [ ] Create the login Authentication
- [ ] Have the corresponding entries for each specified user
- [ ] Do it without the tears

### Extra Things to Add:
- [ ] Each modal to describe each section on the Home page
- [ ] A Modal on the new page that will describe each type. Like a help button. Maybe the the button should be a question mark in a circle.

### CSS. Don't cry over CSS!
- [ ] Make the app have a uniform design
- [ ] Color Scheme = Warm browns and red tones.
- [ ] Utilize Divs and Classes to make the CSS easier.
- [ ] Get better at Flexbox.

#### Possible Challenges:
1. I get my first dose of the COVID shot on Saturday....hopefully I won't be as out of commission as I fear but I want to be able to get my pages connected and running properly by the end of Tomorrow, work on Login Authentication on Friday to Saturday, and then worry about CSS from Sunday to Monday. I want to at least get a good night sleep before presentation day.
2. CSS. I just know that the CSS is going to make me cry like no other.
